# Virtual Teaching Board


Real-time finger-tracked virtual whiteboard with an upward-swipe "slide up" pager. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe.


## Features
- Real-time fingertip tracking (index finger tip) using MediaPipe.
- A tall canvas (virtual whiteboard) that you can write on with your finger.
- Gesture: swipe up to slide the board upward (like moving to next page) — old content remains.
- Save the whole board as an image.
- Smoothening to reduce jitter.
